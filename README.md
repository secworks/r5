**Not completed. Does NOT work. Do. Not. Use.**


## Introduction
Since reading up and started to play with RISC-V, I've getten interested
in seeing how the details of the ISA reflects on the
implementation. Thus I want to try and implement it.

This core will quite probably not add any meaningful difference compared
to any other core.

The core should at least support the base RV32I instruction set. But
quite possibly also the (C)ompressed and (M)ath extensions. The core
will be implemented in real hardware on FPGAs and will thus support
debugging. Any day.
